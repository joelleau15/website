      <h2>Designing and Launching a Weekly Automated Market Update Report to Financial Clients</h2>

      As the bridge between capital consumers and capital providers,
      our Debt Capital Markets team spent a substantial amount of time
      <strong>marketing our debt products to a wide assortment of capital consumers.</strong>These included infrastructure funds, generalist private equity funds, and other investors in the infrastructure space, who would utilize our debt-raising
      capabilities to fund acquisitions of toll roads, power plants, pipelines, and other fixed assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking inspiration from competing debt capital markets practices at other banks, we decided a regular informative newsletter to investors would be valuable in keeping our clients apprised of market trends and strengthening our relationships
      with them. Most importantly, however, this would be a <strong>strong demonstration of our team’s analytical and technical capabilities,</strong> which was a large component of the service we provide to our clients. Moreover, as a weekly
      distribution it was essential that an <strong>automated backend was developed</strong> to reduce refresh time and manual labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so working together as the project lead with several senior managers across the Debt Capital Markets and Infrastructure Coverage teams, I sketched out a basic roadmap with key tasks to develop our newsletter product:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <u>Identify the specific client audience:</u> <strong>review key relationships</strong> and determine distribution list
      </li>
      <li><u>Understand client information needs:</u> Consult senior managers responsible for client coverage and analyze historical client activity for contex</li>
      <li><u>Draft newsletter:</u> Begin to incorporate content and design graphics, incorporating feedback from senior managers</li>
      <li><u>Build automated backend:</u> Construct streamlined Excel backup with <strong>intuitive automation</strong> to allow any team member to easily update and refresh data</li>
      <li><u>Test product distribution:</u> Begin automated distribution to select clients and <strong>solicit feedback</strong> to continually add and adjust features accordingly</li>
      <li><u>Scale up distribution:</u> Gradually increase distribution to include full client list</li>
      <li><u>Monitor product:</u> As the lead, serve as point of contact for clients to provide feedback and ask questions. <strong>Continuously assess potential additions and changes, as well as metrics for product performance and success</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now reaching several months of distribution, the newsletter has been touted as a resounding success by our clients and internal recipients alike. Senior managers have indicated the information in the report has led to <strong>interesting
        conversations with clients about the Debt Capital Market team’s capabilities and expertise,</strong> as well as potential opportunities for us to be involved in future debt product needs.
